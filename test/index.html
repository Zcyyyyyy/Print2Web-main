            The Blur Building is an architecture of atmosphere—a fog mass
            resulting from natural and manmade forces. Water is pumped from Lake
            Neuchâtel, filtered, and shot as a fine mist through 35,000
            high-pressure nozzles. A smart weather system reads the shifting
            climatic conditions of temperature, humidity, wind speed and
            direction and regulates water pressure at a variety of zones. Upon
            entering Blur, visual and acoustic references are erased. There is
            only an optical “white-out” and the “white-noise” of pulsing
            nozzles. Contrary to immersive environments that strive for visual
            fidelity in high-definition with ever-greater technical virtuosity,
            Blur is decidedly low-definition. In this exposition pavilion there
            is nothing to see but our dependence on vision itself. It is an
            experiment in de-emphasis on an environmental scale. Movement within
            is unregulated. The public can ascend to the Angel Deck via a stair
            that emerges through the fog into the blue sky. Water is not only
            the site and primary material of the building; it is also a culinary
            pleasure. The public can drink the building. Within, is an immersive
            acoustic environment by Christian Marclay. The lightweight
            tensegrity structure measures 300 feet wide by 200 feet deep by 75
            feet high and is supported by four columns.

            On the first day of the new year of 2018, I was scanning my eyes
            around a desolate and dusty corner of the land near the Center for
            Contemporary Art in Santa Fe. As soon as I spotted the building a
            wave of excitement and relief poured over me. Even though it was
            only 9:30 in the morning, the New Mexico sun was relentless, so I
            slid on my sunglasses to cut the glare and get a better look at what
            I came to see: a boxy adobe-style structure that appeared to be
            sprouting from a lumpy mound of earth.
            <br />
            <br />
            The surrounding carpet of flaxen weeds and grass only amplified the
            depressing state of the building. My hiking boots crunched against
            the gravel-strewn ground as I approached. I was close enough to see
            the crusty edges of the cracked stucco walls leading up to the
            entrance and the black wrought iron gate that barred outsiders from
            entering the building was still erected.
            <br />
            <br />
            The padlock securing the gate looked flimsy enough but getting
            arrested for breaking and entering while on vacation wasn’t
            something that appealed to me. So instead, I got close, squatted
            down and poked my head as far between the wide-set bars as I could
            and looked up. There it was: a square opening in the dingy white
            ceiling that perfectly framed a striking patch of blue sky.”

            "At first it gave me a feeling of stress, when more of the face was
            out of the water, but now to me she communicates sadness, a lot of
            sadness," Triana Gil, a visitor viewing the sculpture, told Reuters

            This nameless library as a sealed room of closed books symbolizes a
            large number of victims of the brutal holocaust and tells the untold
            stories of victims’ lives buried within them. The namelessness is an
            attempt to describe that can not be described or is not even
            readable. The sealed shut doors are the metaphor for the conclusion,
            closure, and that of—finality.

            <br />
            Just like you immerse yourself in the books and revisit the era of
            the past, this sculpture is a place where memories happen, needless
            to say, these are sad. And it also doesn’t console, rather it is
            intended to evoke the memories of the tragedy and brutality of the
            holocaust. From the religious perspective, the memorial provides an
            appreciation of Judaism: The concept of Jews as People of the Book
            (not to other Abrahamic religions), referring to an identity
            specifically rooted in the Torah

            seasonal word used in haiku for late spring.For many people, this is
            also the time when they lose interest due to the flower season being
            over. However, I want to feel a connection with life by thinking
            about late spring, when the crimson stamens clinging to boughs fall,
            and the season when fresh greens appear. This work was born from the
            desire to ponder the past and future, things invisible to the naked
            eye.
